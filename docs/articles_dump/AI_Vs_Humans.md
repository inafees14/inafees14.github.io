# AI Cold War 2.0: Progress, Peril, and Paradoxes

---

## Introduction
In recent years, artificial intelligence gone from a science fiction to engine driving, economics, education, politics and almost everyday of our life.  How fast it became a part of our life isn't it? 

We are living in through an arms race, but this time weapon is artificial intelligence. 

The 20th century had the Nuclear arms race; and here in 21st century we have AI arms race. The only difference this time is; the AI game has not just two players (US vs Soviet). Dozens of big corporations, nations and international community locked in this game. 

Artificial intelligence is meant to make human's life simpler yet to outbuild one another often feels less about solving the problems and more about prestige, money and visibility. 

When the concept of artificial intelligence first emerged, we believed it would help us complete our work more efficiently. But now, it seems more like a race to prove who leads in the digital battlefield of AI.
